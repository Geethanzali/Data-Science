# Crime Warning System

Implemented Warning System and performed data mining for a specific place using density clustering algorithms. 

**Dataset:** Chicago Crime DataSet

**Implementation**

1) Performed **Data mining** to identify occurence of crime in chicago area

2) **Crime Predictive Analysis** for likelihood of future crimes

3) Density Clustering Based Algorithms for Warning system (DBSCAN & HDBSCAN)

Gven the Attribute that is the latitude and longitude, the system will give out useful information: 

**a)** Total number of crimes occured in this area,
**b)** Number of types of offense occured in this area,
**c)** Most frequent type of crime occurence and
